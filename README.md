# Architecture

Software can be engineered and structured in numerous ways, but it does not mean it should.  With over twenty four years of software engineering experience comes the understanding that there are information rules that govern the writing software, even if they are not curretnly taught in our computer science classes.  These information rules are taught, though indirectly, when students are taught the natural sciences, especially biochemistry and biology, as these two fields are the study of the most complex computer systems that exist today: the [cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJyUtbn0O5Y) and the [mitchonria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrS2uROUjK4) that power them. 

leap in technology has occured and the concept of a traditonal spoke and wheel business is transforming.  Businesses now need to be architected to exist in a distributed fashion.  The busineses will exist as distributed blockchains.  They come into existance when blockchains are formed, and die when the last node in the blockchain disappears.  This repository discusses and provides the foundation for the architecture for these new business models and systems.  This [project](https://github.com/E01D/Architecture/wiki) is used to discuss general csharp coding architecuture concepts and how these concepts can be combined to form block chains ecosystems and digital cells that access these ecosystems. 

Becusae this project has to incoroporate so many ideas together, it is also an architectural study that enables programmers to see how various concepts exists together in a cohesive architecture.  This project uses a bunch of small projects to keep ideas well defined and their dependencies well understood.

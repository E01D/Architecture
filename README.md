# Architecture

 A leap in technology has occured and the concept of a traditonal spoke and wheel business is over.  Businesses now need to be architected to exist in a distributed fashion.  The busineses will exist as distributed blockchains.  They come into existance when blockchains are formed, and die when the last node in the blockchain disappears.  This repository discusses and provides the foundation for the architecture for these new business models and systems.  This [project](https://github.com/E01D/Architecture/wiki) is used to discuss general csharp coding architecuture concepts and how these concepts can be combined to form block chains ecosystems and digital cells that access these ecosystems. 

Becusae this project has to incoroporate so many ideas together, it is also an architectural study that enables programmers to see how various concepts exists together in a cohesive architecture.  This project uses a bunch of small projects to keep ideas well defined and their dependencies well understood.
